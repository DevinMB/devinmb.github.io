# About Me

As a developer with a keen interest in event streaming and data processing technologies, I've recently been focusing on **Kafka**. My journey in software development, especially in the context of banking and financial services, has led me to explore and specialize in Kafka and API work, leveraging my background in finance and software development to build robust, scalable solutions.

## Project 1: Kafka-Based Data Streaming Platform

This project involves the development of a data streaming platform using Kafka, designed to handle high-volume financial transactions in real-time. The platform ensures reliable data processing and distribution, catering to critical banking operations.

### GitHub Repositories:

- **Repo 1: Core Streaming Engine**

  - **Description:** This repository contains the core components of the streaming platform, including Kafka producers, consumers, and stream processors.

- **Repo 2: API Integration Module**
  - [Link to Repo](#)
  - **Description:** This repository focuses on the API layer that integrates the streaming platform with banking systems, facilitating data exchange and operations.

## Project 2: Real-Time Analytics Dashboard

A real-time analytics dashboard that leverages Kafka streams to aggregate, process, and visualize financial data. This project aims to provide insights and analytics for financial data in real-time, supporting decision-making processes.

### GitHub Repositories:

- **Repo 1: Dashboard Backend**
  - [Link to Repo](#)
  - **Description:** Backend services for the analytics dashboard, handling data processing and aggregation using Kafka Streams.

- **Repo 2: Dashboard Frontend**
  - [Link to Repo](#)
  - **Description:** The frontend component of the dashboard, built to display analytics and insights derived from the processed financial data.
